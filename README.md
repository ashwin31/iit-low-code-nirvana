# Introduction

Want to create an application to solve a real-life problem in a few hours? Accept our Challenge! 

 Parentheses Labs & Runcode.io brings to you the Low code Nirvana - a unique low code Hackathon that will bring out the most innovative and creative you.  

# Parentheses Labs 
provides Low code solutions to small and medium businesses for automating their workflows. We are partnered with several low code technology platforms like Stripe, Big commerce and Bubble.io to create custom solutions to reduce operating cost and improve efficiency. Our objective is to make Low code Technology more affordable and accessible to everyone. 

# RunCode.io
 is a cloud development environment with a vision to provide a ready to click development environment with a click of a button. You can spin up the online development environment in seconds. With a focus on security, performance, real-time collaboration, reliability, portability. RunCode supports vast Linux-based programming languages and frameworks thereby opening up a world of opportunities for the code-indulgent folks. 

Hackathon comprises of two parts. 

 1. An Online MCQ -test – Weightage 20 % 
 2. Problem statement – Weightage 80 % 

Backend on node express built on RunCode to be ready before the d-Day 
On the d-Day the participants create the Bubble Front end. 
Finals – Top 5 candidates are selected to present their work. Winners TBD.

# Round 2 Problem statement

## Product API

This is a Node.js Express app that serves a list of products to the Bubble frontend. The app provides endpoints for the CRUD operations of products.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on runcode.io for development and testing purposes.

1.  Click on the “Open in RunCode” button  in https://github.com/parentheseslabs/iit-low-code-nirvana/ to launch the basic express app that you can work on.
2.  Now, you can see the workspace in your runcode dashboard.
3.  You can share/start/stop/delete it.
4.  Every workspace is a vscode in the browser, you can install, configure, and run your code in the vscode terminal.
5.  You need to run the code with “npm run start” and then you can see the output in this format https://<port>-<workspace_domain>/ for example if your workspace domain is [fancy-sunset-87165010.eu-ws3.runcode.io](https://fancy-sunset-87165010.eu-ws3.runcode.io/?tkn=553940de2b6d490babcdd07c6163b746) and you are running the code on port 3000 then your output will be on https://3000-fancy-sunset-87165010.eu-ws3.runcode.io
6.  The boilerplate code having basic routes, you need to write complete code.
7.  You can use “thunder client” (vscode extension) or postman to test the API

## Bubble.io Frontend

**User persona**

1.  Admin  
2.  User
   
Admin-  Signup/ Login redirects to landing page which displays the list of products and the quantities in which they are available.  The page will reflect the number of products available in the inventory.

**From this page**

1.  They can create a product
2.  Edit the product (Quantity and description)
3.  Delete a product
    

Any changes in the bubble app should be able to change the original database

**Customer**

After login/ Sign up page the customer can view all the product listings with the real time quantity and description. They can add products into a cart (more than one) and order the product (No need to create workflows for product ordering).

A customer order should be able to decrease the quantity of product in the original inventory.
